  - The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung Galaxy Tablet and Samsung Galaxy 7, Samsung Galaxy 8, Samsung A12.
  - A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all of the pages were linking correctly. 
  - Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. I aso had my client test the website to see if it was what they wanted.

## Known Bugs
- Had difficulty getting from index.html to quiz.html using buttons for quiz choice. _This was fixed by putting href instead of button._  
- Had difficulty with getting questions to print on quiz page.  _This was fixed code to randomly choose question and write the answers._
- Need to have answer be chosen by the user. I was going to have the user enter a letter but may have user either click answer or on radio button. _replaced code that was for answer box with code that will allow the user to click on the corect answer_


## Deployment
